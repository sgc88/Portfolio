<div class="about">
  <p>I first discovered my passion for coding when I always try to understand how our website works, what type of framework/database is been used in the back of our website at work.After having a successful 11 years in banking, I realized that I was ready to add a coding skill to my career path and am so happy with my decision.
I'm from Turkey, I was born and raised in Istanbul. After working at the bank for several years in Turkey I moved the US in 2011. After working at Citibank for over 2 successfull years I discovered my passion about coding and I studied full stack full development at General Assembly for 12 weeks,  self studied  another 8 weeks before the cohort. I ask questions, a lot of questions. I debug.. everything. I am focused problem solver, love to find out what is causing the issue and how it can be solved.</p>
